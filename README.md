# Cybersecurity-Portfolio

  Introduction
    My name is Brandon Adams and I am a former US Army Cyber Network Defender (MOS 25D) who is now pursuing a formal career in Cybersecurity. The Army is what made my passion for Cybersecurity even begin as I had to transition out of my old Military Occupational Speciality (MOS) to Cyber Defense and that's where I was first introduced to SANS training and began to start being seriously interested in pursuing Cybersecurity as a career outside of the Miitary. 

  ### NCL Fall 2025
This was my first experience with NCL, but not my first CTF experience as I have had a few prior so I was familiar with the concept. I believe there is a lot to be learned from these experiences and I feel no matter what side of Cybersecurity or Information Security you are on, there is a benefit in participating in these CTF exercises.

My results in my opinion were favorable, although ofcourse I would have liked to do better for myself. The biggest bar to my grade I believe was Time. Next chance I will for sure put a more serious effort into committing more of time during the allotted time. 

## NCL Highlights 
A few notes here, I am most proud of me squashing the Reverse Engineering of a specific binary using Ghidra. It was my first time using Ghidra personally after doing a bit of research and playing around in the Interface I was able to score points during our team game @ 100% accuracy. # Another note about the team game, in my opinion was much more enjoyable as you are able to collaborate with other humans and I feel like that is advantage in itself as sometimes you just need another person's perspective or opinion to give you that last break you need to overcome any adversity you may be facing in working on the challenges.
